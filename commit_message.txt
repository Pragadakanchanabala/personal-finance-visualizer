feat: Implement multi-user auth and major dashboard enhancements

This commit introduces a complete multi-user authentication system and significantly upgrades the dashboard's features and UI.

Key Features & Changes:

Multi-User Authentication:

Integrated NextAuth.js with the Google Provider for secure sign-in and session management.

All private data (Expenses, Budgets, Earnings) is now linked to a specific userId.

API routes are fully secured to ensure users can only access and modify their own data.

Shared Categories Model:

Categories are now global and shared between all users.

A seed.js script has been added to populate the database with a default set of common categories.

Monthly Earnings & Budgeting Intelligence:

Users can now set their earnings for each month.

The "Set Budget" modal intelligently calculates the total budget for the selected month and displays a warning if it exceeds the user's earnings.

Dynamic Monthly Dashboard:

Added month and year selectors to the dashboard.

All charts (Pie Chart, Budget vs. Actual) and the "Monthly Snapshot" card now dynamically update to reflect the selected time period.

The snapshot provides a clear summary of savings or overspending.

UI/UX Overhaul:

Renamed "Transactions" to "Expenses" throughout the application for better clarity.

Implemented a more attractive UI with a soft, blurred background image and a cleaner, card-based layout.

Redesigned the "Monthly Snapshot" with icons and color-coded indicators for a more intuitive user experience.

Bug Fixes:

Resolved numerous issues related to data fetching, rendering, and form submissions to ensure a smooth user experience.
